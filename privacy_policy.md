## Overview

The Archive of Argentum ("we", "our", or "us") operates the EDH Commander Analysis API ("Service"). This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our Service.

## Information We Collect

We do not require you to provide any personal information to use our Service. Our API responds to requests for Magic: The Gathering EDH (Elder Dragon Highlander) commander data and does not require user registration or personal data collection.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **API Request Data**: When you use our Service, we may temporarily log:
  - Request timestamps
  - Commander names being queried
  - API endpoint calls
  - Basic request metadata (no personal identifiers)
- **Usage Analytics**: We may collect aggregated, anonymized usage statistics to improve our Service

### Third-Party Services
Our Service retrieves publicly available Magic: The Gathering commander data from [EDHRec](https://edhrec.com). We do not control EDHRec's data collection or privacy practices.

## How We Use Information
